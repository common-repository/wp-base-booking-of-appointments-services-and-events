"<b>Admin:</b> A user who has the WordPress \"manage_options\" capability. "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<b>Service:</b> The action of doing help or work for the client. WP BASE is "
"basically about booking of services with or without nominated service "
"providers and with or without a predetermined price. Services can be hourly "
"or daily, free or paid, may be requiring down payment or not. Hourly "
"services can be from 10 minutes up to 24 hours. Services longer than 24 "
"hours is not currently supported."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1451
#, php-format
msgid ""
"<b>Provider:</b> The person who is providing the service client is applying "
"and booking for. A provider may give a single or multiple services. "
"Providers are optional, i.e. you can be the sole provider giving the "
"services. If no service providers are defined, WP BASE assumes that there is "
"a single provider giving all of the services. This sole provider can be "
"selected using %s setting. Only members of the website can be assigned as "
"providers."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1455
msgid ""
"<b>Dummy Service Provider:</b> is a \"fake\" service provider for whom "
"emails will be forwarded to another (real) user, selected on Advanced "
"Settings page. You can use dummy option to enrich your service provider "
"alternatives and variate your working schedules. For example, suppose that "
"you are giving Service A only on weekdays, and Service B only on weekends. "
"Then you can define Provider 1 to give Service A working on weekdays, and "
"Provider 2 to give Service B working on weekends. Note that using dummies is "
"not a direct alternative of setting service capacity. Both options have its "
"advantages and different area of application."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1459
msgid ""
"<b>Working Hours:</b> Define in which hours and days service providers are "
"available and  as a result, in which hours and days services are bookable. "
"Working hours are related to service providers with the exception of "
"\"Unassigned Provider\" which defines business working hours. Service "
"providers' working hours can be outside working hours of the business."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1463
msgid ""
"<b>Security Deposit:</b> Deposit is, by definition, a sum of money or "
"equivalent given as security for an item acquired for temporary use. For "
"example if you are renting some facilities and these facilities include some "
"items that can be damaged by the client, you can ask a deposit in advance "
"and refund it after client return the facility and you check and see that "
"there was no harm. Since deposits are almost always delivered as manual "
"payments (cash, check, or other valuables) and kept in special accounts, "
"deposit amount is NOT added to the one that client pays via online payment "
"gateways, e.g. Paypal. However, they are added to the total due and affect "
"the balance of the booking. "
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1467
msgid ""
"<b>Down Payment:</b> Down Payment is a percentage or portion of the service "
"price and it is again for security, but in this case, to cover any indirect "
"losses in case client cancels the booking or does not show up at all. When "
"payment is required to confirm a booking, this is the amount that client "
"needs to pay through online payment gateways."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1471
msgid ""
"<b>Status:</b> is the latest state of an appointment. Statuses can be "
"automatically (for example a pending appointment automatically becomes "
"\"removed\" after a preset time) or manually changed, i.e. using admin side "
"Appointments page or front end page having Manage Bookings Addon shortcode. "
"These are statuses used in WP BASE:"
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1484
msgid ""
"<b>Time slot:</b> An interval of time with an exact start and end value "
"which defines the appointment start and end date/time. Unless it is a break "
"time or holiday, each time slot can turn into an appointment, when booked. "
"WP BASE produces time slots based on duration of the service to be booked "
"and working hours of the service provider. For example, for a service of one "
"hour duration and a service provider working from 9 to 5 and having a break "
"between 12pm-1pm, time slots will be: 9am, 10am, 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm. "
"Time slots can be presented on the front end in list view, monthly calendar "
"view or weekly calendar view, depending on the shortcode used."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1488
msgid ""
"<b>Service Capacity:</b> is the number of clients that can be served at a "
"given time slot. Normally service capacity is determined by the number of "
"service providers. For example if you employ 4 hairdressers for a "
"hairstyling saloon, you have a capacity of 4 for hair cut service, for any "
"time slot that these providers are working. This means any time slot can be "
"booked 4 times by different clients. There are cases, however, that you need "
"to increase or decrease the service capacity. You can do this by entering "
"the required number inside the capacity field of the related service. For "
"example, if you are organizing city tours, and you have a minibus for 10 "
"passengers, you can simply enter 10 as the capacity value. Then 10 different "
"clients can book for the city tour. Or, as an example of decreasing "
"capacity, suppose there are 3 dentists in a dental clinic having 2 "
"examination rooms. Then service capacity has to be set to 2 although there "
"are 3 dentists who can use it. If some resources are limiting your services "
"like in this case, you can set the capacity according to the number of "
"resources."
msgstr ""

#: includes/admin/help.php:1492
msgid ""
"<b>Location Capacity:</b> is the number of services that can be given at a "
"given time slot for the selected location. Contrary to service capacity, it "
"cannot be increased. Usage example: A \"Hairdresser\" location has \"Gents' "
"Haircut\" and \"Ladies' Haircut\" services. There are 7 hairdressers who can "
"work in both of the services (or some can work only in one of the services, "
"which will not make any difference for this example), but there are only 5 "
"barber chairs. If chairs can be used for both services, then set location "
"capacity as 5 which will limit total bookable slots as 5 at any given time. "
"However if 3 of the chairs are for Gents' and 2 of them are for Ladies', set "
"service capacities as 3 and 2, respectively."

"<b>Parent & Child Bookings:</b> WP BASE has several Addons which can create "
"multiple bookings at a single checkout. Examples of such Addons are Shopping "
"Cart, WooCommerce, Packages, Recurring Appointments, Extras. When bookings "
"are written to the database, one of them (usually the one which will start "
"last) is automatically selected to lead the others. This one is called "
"parent booking and the rest are called child bookings. Each child booking is "
